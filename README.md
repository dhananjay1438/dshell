## Why written in C++ and not C
To be honest I don't know why I started writing it in c++, I thought it would be easier to write it in c++ but boy I was wrong most of the calls are for c (or atleast that is what I think) so std::string or any fancy stuff doesn't work.
So most of the code is in C :)
